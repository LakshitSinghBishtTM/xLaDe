# Metrics Summary

This document summarizes evaluation dimensions across xLaDe experiments.

| Experiment | Enforcement | Scope | Reversible | Affects Kernel |
|------------|-------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| EXP-001    | Lean-based  | Local | Yes        | No             |
| EXP-002    | CI-based    | Global| Yes        | No             |

## Key Observations
- Ecosystem policies can be enforced without kernel modification
- Experiments remain isolated and reversible
- Governance and workflow changes are measurable without benchmarks
