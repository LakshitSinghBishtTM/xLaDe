# xLaDe Metrics

This directory documents qualitative and structural metrics
used to evaluate ecosystem-level experiments in xLaDe.

xLaDe does not aim to measure mathematical strength or proof performance.
Instead, it evaluates:
- enforceability of policies
- scope and isolation of experiments
- impact on developer workflow
- reversibility and maintenance cost

Metrics are collected per experiment.
