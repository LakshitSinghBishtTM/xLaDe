# Why xLaDe?

Lean has a strong ecosystem for formalization and verification.
However, experimentation with workflows, governance, and repository
structure often lacks a safe and documented space.

xLaDe exists to provide:
- isolation for ecosystem experiments
- explicit architectural boundaries
- a place to test ideas without upstream disruption
