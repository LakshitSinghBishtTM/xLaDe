# Security Policy

## Philosophy

We do NOT trust any centralised infrastructure.  
I couldn't write it more simply.

---

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version for security updates.  
To know the latest version, please check [`VERSION`](../docs/VERSION) file or type command `xlade --version` if in CLI.

## Security Scope

| Layer               | Risk level | Reason                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Official Website    | Critical   | primary entry of xLaDe, authenticated by the cryptographic identity of the onion service (unless private key is exposed) |
| Keys                | Critical   | keys published in the official site are authoritative, keys published elsewhere should be verified against them          |
| GitHub              | High       | controlled by microsoft, not trusted                                                                                     |
| Mirrors             | High       | not under our explicit control, similar to github                                                                        |
| Distribution        | Variable   | torrent is seeded by core team, however, we advise to verify checksum against official site, pypi is not trusted         |
| CLI                 | Medium     | cli tool is the primary product and remains our focus                                                                    |
| Documentation       | Low        | misleading docs can create real risk                                                                                     |
| CI workflows        | Medium     | control what reaches main and other workflows impact project directly                                                    |
| Experiments         | Low        | we generally review scripts, but mistakes may happen, careful behaviour is better                                        |

## Non-Guarantees

- Running experiment scripts added by community 
- Centralised infrastructure such as GitHub
- Dependencies and environments of xLaDe such as Python, Git, etc.
- Reliability and availability of Lean 4, Lake, Elan, etc. 

---

## What not to do

- Cloning xLaDe from random sources not mentioned in official website and repo
- Not verifying our SSH key for commits and assuming trusted
- Not verifying our PGP key before communication
- Not verifying our sha256sums from our website
- Running python v3.13 or less
- Running xLaDe as root
- Running random script files
- Running not updated environment and dependencies
- Running too old versions of xLaDe when new versions are up for months
- Not updating xLaDe after publishing of a DCVE
- Using random instructions not authorised by xLaDe team

---

## Accountability 

- We are accountable for the official website
- We are accountable for the entire codebase and documentation
- We are accountable for publishing our PGP key, SSH key, and checksums

In case, any of the above three are not correct or broken, please report to us as soon as possible.

## Not our responsibility

- Using custom xLaDe forks
- Breaking security assumptions of xLaDe
- Security flaws of older versions
- Making an ultimately secure xLaDe which has theoretically no security flaws
