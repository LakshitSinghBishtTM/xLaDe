# xLaDe Experiments

This directory contains executable ecosystem experiments for Lean 4.

Each experiment explores a change in how Lean is *used*, not how it works.
Experiments may enforce policies, modify build workflows, or introduce
alternative development conventions.

All experiments must:
- be reversible
- avoid kernel modification
- document entry and exit criteria

See `EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md` for the required structure.
